### üîπ Project Name: **Mini Wallet Management System**

**Goal:**
To build a **simple yet robust digital wallet backend** that handles **money transactions safely, atomically, and consistently** ‚Äî just like a real e-wallet system (Paytm, PhonePe, etc.), but simplified for learning and demonstration.

---

## üí° **Primary Use Case**

The system allows **customers** to:

1. **Create a wallet** linked to their profile.
2. **Add money (credit)** into their wallet.
3. **Spend or withdraw (debit)** money.
4. **Transfer money** between wallets.
5. **View all past transactions** (ledger/history).

Everything happens **within the same database transaction** so that **no money is lost or duplicated**, even if two operations occur at the same time (concurrency-safe).

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Technical Goals / Learning Objectives**

| Concept                       | Explanation                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Transactional Consistency** | Using `@Transactional` ensures debit and credit operations either *both happen* or *both fail*. |
| **Optimistic Locking**        | Prevents double spending when multiple users access the same wallet simultaneously.             |
| **Idempotency**               | Ensures that reprocessing the same transaction doesn‚Äôt duplicate results.                       |
| **Layered Architecture**      | Clean separation between controller, service, repository, and entity layers.                    |
| **Optional Caching (Redis)**  | Speeds up balance reads and reduces DB hits.                                                    |
| **Scalability-Ready Design**  | Can later evolve into microservices, add Kafka, JWT, etc.                                       |

## üß© **Core Entities and Their Roles**

| Entity          | Description                                                                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Customer**    | Represents the end user of the wallet system.                                         |
| **Wallet**      | Holds the current balance of each customer. Each customer has exactly **one** wallet. |
| **Transaction** | Records each debit, credit, or transfer action ‚Äî forming an immutable ledger.         |

## üîÑ **System Flow (Step-by-Step)**

Let‚Äôs walk through the **main flow** of how things work in this project üëá

---

### üßç Step 1: Customer Onboarding

* Customer registers using:

  ```http
  POST /api/customers
  ```
* A `Customer` record is created in MySQL.
* Optionally, an initial `Wallet` is automatically created for the new customer.

---

### üí≥ Step 2: Wallet Creation

* Either auto-created during registration **or** manually via:

  ```http
  POST /api/wallets/{customerId}/create
  ```
* Wallet starts with `balance = 0` (or configurable initial balance).
* `Wallet` is linked to the `Customer` via one-to-one mapping.

---

### üí∞ Step 3: Add Money (Credit)

* When customer adds money:

  ```http
  POST /api/wallets/{walletId}/credit
  {
    "amount": 500.00
  }
  ```
* System:

  1. Fetches wallet.
  2. Adds amount to balance.
  3. Creates a **Transaction** of type `CREDIT`.
  4. Commits both balance update + transaction record **atomically** (`@Transactional`).

---

### üí∏ Step 4: Spend or Withdraw (Debit)

* When customer makes a purchase or withdrawal:

  ```http
  POST /api/wallets/{walletId}/debit
  {
    "amount": 200.00
  }
  ```
* System:

  1. Checks if wallet has sufficient balance.
  2. Deducts amount.
  3. Records a **Transaction** of type `DEBIT`.
  4. If insufficient funds, it throws an error ‚Üí no changes saved (atomic rollback).

---

### üîÅ Step 5: Transfer Between Wallets

* To send money from one customer to another:

  ```http
  POST /api/wallets/transfer
  {
    "fromWalletId": 1,
    "toWalletId": 2,
    "amount": 100.00
  }
  ```
* System:

  1. Starts a DB transaction.
  2. Debits sender‚Äôs wallet.
  3. Credits receiver‚Äôs wallet.
  4. Creates **two transaction records** (`DEBIT` & `CREDIT`).
  5. Commits all or none ‚Äî if any step fails, rollback happens.

---

### üìú Step 6: View Transaction History

* Customer can view past transactions:

  ```http
  GET /api/transactions/wallet/{walletId}
  ```
* Returns list of all transactions ‚Äî acts as the **ledger** for audit or debugging.

## üß† **How the Layers Work Together**

### 1. **Controller Layer**

* Handles HTTP requests and responses.
* Delegates logic to the service layer.
* Example: `WalletController.credit()` calls `WalletService.credit()`.

### 2. **Service Layer**

* Contains the **business logic**.
* Manages atomic operations with `@Transactional`.
* Example: `transfer()` ensures debit & credit happen together.

### 3. **Repository Layer**

* Handles database operations via Spring Data JPA.
* Example: `walletRepository.save(wallet)`.

### 4. **Model Layer**

* Defines entities and their relationships.
* Annotated with `@Entity`, `@OneToOne`, `@ManyToOne`, etc.

### 5. **Optional Layers**

* **DTOs** ‚Üí for clean request/response objects.
* **Redis Cache** ‚Üí to cache wallet balances.
* **Scheduler** ‚Üí for retrying failed transactions.

## üß© **Simple Example Flow**

### üé¨ Example Scenario

1. Rakesh registers ‚Üí gets Customer ID = 1
2. His wallet is created ‚Üí Wallet ID = 101, balance = ‚Çπ0
3. He credits ‚Çπ1000 ‚Üí balance = ‚Çπ1000
4. He buys something for ‚Çπ300 ‚Üí balance = ‚Çπ700
5. Transfers ‚Çπ200 to his friend‚Äôs wallet ‚Üí balance = ‚Çπ500
6. Can view all these transactions via `/api/transactions/wallet/101`

Everything is **atomic**, consistent, and fully logged.

---

## üöÄ **Future Expansion (Beyond Mini Version)**

Once this works perfectly, you can:

* Add **JWT Authentication** (using `UserDetailsService`).
* Add **Kafka** for async events.
* Split into **microservices** (WalletService, TransactionService).
* Add **API Gateway + Registry**.
* Move to **eventual consistency (Saga pattern)**.
